# Kaiga Admin Panel Guide

## Overview

The Kaiga Admin Panel is a comprehensive management system that allows administrators to manage all aspects of the e-commerce store including products, orders, users, and analytics.

## Accessing the Admin Panel

### Admin Login
- Navigate to `/admin/login` to access the admin login page
- Only users with admin role can access the admin panel
- Non-admin users will be redirected to the home page

### First Time Setup

To create your first admin user, you need to add the admin role to a user in the database:

1. Create a regular user account through the normal signup process
2. Run this SQL query in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
VALUES ('YOUR_USER_ID_HERE', 'admin');
```

Replace `YOUR_USER_ID_HERE` with the actual user ID from the `auth.users` table.

## Database Structure

### Admin-Specific Tables

#### admin_activity_logs
Tracks all admin actions for audit purposes:
- `id`: UUID (primary key)
- `admin_id`: UUID (references auth.users)
- `action`: Text (type of action)
- `entity_type`: Text (product, order, user, etc.)
- `entity_id`: UUID (ID of affected entity)
- `details`: JSONB (additional details)
- `ip_address`: Text
- `created_at`: Timestamp

#### Enhanced Tables
- `products`: Added `created_by`, `updated_by`, `updated_at`
- `orders`: Added `admin_notes` for internal notes

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All admin operations are protected by RLS policies that check the user's admin role:
- Admins can perform full CRUD operations on products
- Admins can view and manage all orders
- Admins can view all user profiles and manage roles
- All admin actions respect proper security boundaries

## Security Features

1. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only users with admin role can access the panel
2. **Protected Routes**: All admin routes require authentication and admin privileges
3. **Secure Login**: Separate login page with enhanced security
4. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions can be tracked (database ready)
5. **RLS Policies**: Database-level security ensures data protection
