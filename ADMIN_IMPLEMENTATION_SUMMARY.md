## What Was Built

### 1. Core Infrastructure

#### Authentication System
- **AdminContext** (`src/contexts/AdminContext.tsx`)
  - Manages admin authentication state
  - Checks user admin role from database
  - Provides admin status throughout the application

- **Admin Login Page** (`src/pages/admin/AdminLogin.tsx`)
  - Dedicated login page at `/admin/login`
  - Verifies admin role after authentication
  - Prevents non-admin access
  - Modern gradient design with security focus

- **Protected Routes** (`src/components/admin/ProtectedAdminRoute.tsx`)
  - Wraps all admin routes
  - Redirects non-authenticated users to login
  - Redirects non-admin users to home page
  - Shows loading state during verification

#### Layout & Navigation

## Routes Implemented

### Public Routes
- `/admin/login` - Admin login page

### Protected Admin Routes
- `/admin` - Dashboard
- `/admin/products` - Products list
- `/admin/products/new` - Add product
- `/admin/products/edit/:id` - Edit product
- `/admin/orders` - Orders list
- `/admin/users` - Users list
- `/admin/analytics` - Analytics
- `/admin/settings` - Settings

---

## Security Implementation

### Authentication Flow
1. User attempts to access admin route
2. System checks if user is authenticated
3. If not authenticated → redirect to `/admin/login`
4. If authenticated → check admin role in database
5. If not admin → redirect to home page
6. If admin → grant access

### Database Security
- All tables have RLS enabled
- Admin-specific policies check user role
- Functions use SECURITY DEFINER with proper search_path
- Audit logging capability built-in

### Best Practices Applied
- No sensitive data in frontend
- Role verification on every request
- Protected API endpoints via RLS
- Secure session management
- SQL injection prevention via parameterized queries

## How to Use

### Initial Setup

1. **Create Admin User**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
   VALUES ('USER_ID_HERE', 'admin');
   ```
   See `CREATE_ADMIN_USER.sql` for detailed instructions.

2. **Apply Database Migration**:
   Run the SQL migration when the database connection is available to create admin tables and policies.

3. **Access Admin Panel**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/login`
   - Enter admin credentials
   - Access granted to admin dashboard
